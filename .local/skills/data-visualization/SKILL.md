# Data Visualization Skill

This skill helps you create interactive data visualization apps with charts, data tables, and CSV handling.

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user asks to:

- **Create a dashboard, report, or data exploration app** with data from any source
- **Build charts, graphs, or data tables**
- **Visualize data** from integrations (Stripe, Google Analytics, Linear, databases, etc.)
- **Create an interactive analytics dashboard** with filters and controls
- **Build a reporting interface**, metrics dashboard, or analysis report
- **Explore or investigate a dataset** with filters and drill-down
- **Combine multiple data sources** into a unified visualization

**Key point:** This skill handles data fetching internally. You do NOT need to query data first using other skills - this skill will use `searchIntegrations()` and `proposeIntegration()` to connect to data sources as part of building the app.

### Example user requests

- "Create a dashboard showing my Stripe revenue"
- "Build a sales analytics dashboard"
- "Analyze my revenue data and present the findings"
- "Create a report explaining why conversions dropped"
- "Let me explore my customer data with filters"
- "Build a tool to browse and filter our product catalog"
- "Visualize this CSV file"

## When NOT to Use

- The user is asking questions about data in chat (e.g., "How many Linear issues were closed last week?") - use `query-integration-data` skill
- The user simply wants to fetch/export/transform data without visualization - use `query-integration-data` skill
- The user is not asking for any visual output or web interface

## Architecture

This skill uses the **react-vite scaffold** with backend conventions from the **`pnpm-workspace` skill**:

1. Create the artifact (`createArtifact()` with type `data-visualization`)
2. Install data-viz packages and patch CSS (chart colors + print styles)
3. Follow the contract-first backend flow from the `pnpm-workspace` skill (`references/openapi.md`, `references/server.md`, `references/db.md`)
4. Launch a design subagent (async) for the frontend
5. Implement API routes in the shared `artifacts/api-server/`

See `references/common-bootstrap.md` for the full step-by-step workflow.

**IMPORTANT:** Data visualization artifacts must use the design subagent workflow, not generateFrontend(). The reference files contain critical layout and styling specifications that only the design subagent can consume.

## App Type Classification

Classify the user's request into one of three types. If ambiguous, default to Dashboard.

### Dashboard (default)

**Signals:** "dashboard", "monitor", "KPIs", "metrics overview", "analytics", "track", "real-time"

**Layout:** KPI cards + grid of charts + optional detail table. Wide container (`max-w-[1400px]`).

**Read these references:**

- `references/common-bootstrap.md` — Setup and workflow
- `references/dashboard-workflow.md` — Steps 5-6, checklist, subagent template
- `references/dashboard-layout.md` — Grid patterns, KPI cards
- `references/dashboard-controls.md` — Split refresh with auto-refresh, date filters

**Page structure:** See `references/dashboard-page-structure.md` for composition skeleton

---

### Analysis Report

**Signals:** "report", "analysis", "findings", "explain", "why is", "summarize", "readout", "review", "assessment"

**Layout:** Vertical narrative with embedded charts and written analysis. Narrow container (`max-w-[900px]`).

**Read these references:**

- `references/common-bootstrap.md` — Setup and workflow
- `references/report-workflow.md` — Steps 5-6, checklist, subagent template
- `references/report-layout.md` — Executive summary, section cards, recommendations

**Page structure:** See `references/report-page-structure.md` for composition skeleton

---

### Dataset Explorer

**Signals:** "explore", "investigate", "browse", "filter", "drill down", "search data", "let me query", "look through"

**Layout:** Sidebar filters + central data table + reactive charts. Wide container (`max-w-[1600px]`).

**Read these references:**

- `references/common-bootstrap.md` — Setup and workflow
- `references/explorer-workflow.md` — Steps 5-6, checklist, subagent template
- `references/explorer-layout.md` — Filter sidebar, data table, reactive charts

**Page structure:** See `references/explorer-page-structure.md` for composition skeleton

## Handling Truncated Reference Files

**IMPORTANT:** When reading a reference file, the output may be truncated (indicated by `...[Truncated]` at the end). If truncated, note the last line number shown and re-read the file with `offset` set to that line number minus 10 (for overlap). Repeat until no `...[Truncated]` appears. Do not act on partial instructions from a truncated file.
